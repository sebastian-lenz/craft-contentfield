# Template hierarchy

The real power of the content field unveils once you start building
template hierarchies. In the next steps we'll extend the basic sample
from the previous tutorial section by adding flexible content blocks.
We want the editor of the page to be able to stack text and image blocks.

1. [Create block templates](./01-create-templates.md)
2. [Add the blocks to the content template](./02-alter-content-template.md)
3. [Create an entry](./03-create-entry.md)
